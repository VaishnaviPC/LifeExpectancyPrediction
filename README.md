**Life Expectancy Prediction**

**Problem Statement :**

WHO wants a data driven approach which could help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population. Life_Expectancy_Data.csv file contains the data

**Solution:**

Building a Prediction engine which predicts the life expectancy based on various features like status of the country, GDP, Alcohol consumption, adult mortality rate etc. To build a prediction engine we will use linear regression model.

**Purpose:** 

To perform regression analysis to study life expectancy in different countries

**Steps carried out through Linear Regression for the above business problem: **

1) Loading the Data
2) Understanding the Data
3) Data Preprocessing
4) Exploratory Data Analysis
5) Model Building - Recursive Feature Elimination and Stepwise regression
6) Model Diagnostics
7) Predictions and Evaluations
